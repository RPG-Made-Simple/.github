## Hi there 👋

> _The organization icon is just a placeholder_ 🤫

This organization is a collection of modules made for [FoundryVTT](https://foundryvtt.com/), initiated by [ZotyDev](https://github.com/ZotyDev), and being maintained by me only.

---
### 🎲 Our Goal
Is to to provide the Foundy community (including us) with the best quality possible modules! We aim at making your experience **gamefied**, thus removing a little bit of control from your hands to allow a more streamlined experience!

Since Foundry always requires a little bit more from the GMs, we strongly believe in setup once, reuse forever, you should be able to configure things only one time, and be able to reuse your work across all your adventures (or other people's adventures if you want to share), and because of that we aim at making modules that not only solve a problem, but solve it the best way we can.

### ✔️ What We Do
- Create modules for **Free**
- Update modules for **Free**
- Provide you with support when we have enough time, for **Free**
- Listen for suggestions and requests, for **Free**
- Accept [**donations**](https://ko-fi.com/zotydev) 💸 _if you feel like we deserve it_ 😁

> But we don't want your donations without offering something for that, if you donate you get **access to special polls that decide the next major updates and modules that will be released!**

### ❌ What We Don't Do
- Require any type of **payment** for the above mentioned!
- Develop what already exists

> Note that in the future we could sell modules for a **price**, but we will **sell** only **handmade non-AI content**, we will **never** require payment for modules that provide functionalities or other things like that, **only** content.

### 📃 LICENSE
All our modules, **are** and will **always** be licensed under the [**MIT**](https://github.com/RPG-Made-Simple/.github/blob/main/LICENSE) license, so anyone can use them, contribute or even continue our work if we cease to work on them.

_We make it simple for you_
